# Python Data Structures Practice

Welcome to the Python Data Structures Practice repository! This repository contains simple Python programs that
demonstrate essential data structures such as heaps and linked lists. The file hierarchy has been organized for easy
navigation in the terminal.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the `src` directory:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/JayBhatt2021/python-data-structures-practice.git
$ cd python-data-structures-practice/src
```

## Usage

Follow these steps to run the Python code in the `src` directory:

1. Navigate to the specific directory containing the Python file you want to execute. For example, to explore
   the `queues` directory, use:

```bash
$ cd queues
```

2. Execute the Python script using the `python3` command. For instance, to run `animal_queue.py`, type:

```bash
$ python3 animal_queue.py
```
