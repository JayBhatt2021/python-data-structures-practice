# Python Data Structures Practice

Welcome to the Python Data Structures Practice repository! Here, you'll find simple Python programs that showcase
essential data structures such as heaps and linked lists. The file hierarchy of this repository has been organized for
ease of navigation in the terminal.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the `src` directory:
